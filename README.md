### dbt project for [Strava ELT pipeline](https://github.com/jairus-m/StravaETLPipeline)

This dbt project transforms raw activity data in BigQuery into useful data models for downstream analytics. 

The goal is to be able to use this project to learn about:
- building data models
- learning about DAGs/lineage
- version control for data transformations
- testing the data
- using jinja templating for macros
- working in a dbt project folder
- debugging in the CLI, creating documentation

...and overall, maximing the features of dbt for sustainable/maintainable/scalable data transformations.
